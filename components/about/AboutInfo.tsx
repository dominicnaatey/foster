            We are dedicated to providing youth therapeutic enrichment services

            community-based model to males 9–18 years of age (up to 21 years of
            age if extended foster care is available). This model provides local
            support and services for youth to reside in a community of choice
            and provides a more realistic approach of modeling the world in
            which we live.
